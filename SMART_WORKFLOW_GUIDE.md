# 🧠 Smart ACS CDK Workflow Guide

## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains how to use the **Smart Deployment System** that automatically detects changes in your codebase and optimizes deployments accordingly. Your main stack now represents your entire codebase, and CDK intelligently determines what needs to be deployed.

## 🚀 Key Features

### ✨ Automatic Change Detection
- **File Hashing**: Tracks changes in lambda functions, infrastructure, and configuration
- **Smart Analysis**: Determines what resources have changed since last deployment
- **Optimized Deployments**: Only deploys what's necessary

### 🔄 Deployment Types
- **Full Stack**: When infrastructure or configuration changes
- **Lambda Only**: When only lambda functions change
- **No Deployment**: When no changes are detected

### 📊 Change Tracking
- **Hash-based**: Uses MD5 hashes to detect file changes
- **Persistent**: Stores deployment history in `.deployment-hashes.json`
- **Granular**: Tracks individual lambda functions and infrastructure files

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Smart Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to development (automatically detects changes)
npm run deploy

# Deploy to production (with safety checks)
npm run deploy:prod
```

### 2. Check What Would Be Deployed
```bash
# See what changes would be deployed (without actually deploying)
npm run smart:check
```

### 3. Reset Change Tracking
```bash
# Reset deployment history (treats everything as new)
npm run smart:reset
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### Smart Deployment Commands
```bash
npm run smart:deploy:dev      # Smart deploy to development
npm run smart:deploy:prod     # Smart deploy to production
npm run smart:check           # Check changes without deploying
npm run smart:reset           # Reset deployment history
```

### Legacy Commands (Still Available)
```bash
npm run deploy:dev            # Traditional CDK deploy to dev
npm run deploy:prod           # Traditional CDK deploy to prod
npm run deploy:enhanced:dev   # Enhanced deploy to dev
npm run deploy:enhanced:prod  # Enhanced deploy to prod
```

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Change Analysis
The system analyzes your codebase by:

- **Lambda Functions**: Calculates hash of entire function directory
- **Infrastructure Files**: Tracks changes in CDK stack files
- **Configuration**: Monitors `cdk.json`, `config.env`, `package.json`

### 2. Hash Comparison
- Compares current file hashes with previous deployment
- Identifies new, modified, and unchanged resources
- Determines deployment strategy

### 3. Smart Deployment
- **No Changes**: Skips deployment entirely
- **Lambda Changes Only**: Optimizes for lambda-only deployment
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Performs full stack deployment

## 📁 File Structure

```
acsd2p/
├── .deployment-hashes.json    # Change tracking database
├── scripts/
│   └── smart-deploy.js        # Smart deployment script
├── lib/
│   ├── shared/

└── lambdas/                   # Your lambda functions

```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Set environment (dev/prod)
export ENVIRONMENT=dev

# Override region (optional)
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-1
```

### Change Tracking Files
The system tracks changes in:
- `lambdas/*/` - All lambda function directories
- `lib/acsd2p-stack.ts` - Main stack definition
- `lib/shared/shared-resources.ts` - Shared resources
- `lib/lambda/lambda-resources.ts` - Lambda resources
- `lib/api/api-resources.ts` - API resources
- `lib/queue/queue-resources.ts` - Queue resources
- `cdk.json` - CDK configuration
- `config.env` - Environment configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies

## 📊 Deployment Output

### Change Summary Example

Environment: DEV
Region: us-west-1
Stack: Acsd2PStack-Dev

🔐 Checking AWS credentials...
   Account: 872515253712
   User: arn:aws:iam::872515253712:user/developer

   ✅ Change analysis completed

📊 Change Summary:
==================

🆕 New Resources:
   + Lambda: NewFunction

🔄 Modified Resources:
   ~ Lambda: LoginUser
   ~ Infrastructure: lib/lambda/lambda-resources.ts

✅ Unchanged Resources:
   45 resources unchanged

📈 Deployment Impact:
   ⚡ Lambda-only deployment (function changes only)

🚀 Proceeding with deployment...
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Make changes to lambda functions
# Edit lambdas/LoginUser/lambda_function.py

# Deploy with smart detection
npm run deploy

# System automatically detects LoginUser changes
# Only deploys the modified lambda function
```

### 2. Infrastructure Changes
```bash
# Modify infrastructure code
# Edit lib/lambda/lambda-resources.ts

# Deploy with smart detection
npm run deploy

# System detects infrastructure changes
# Performs full stack deployment
```

### 3. New Function Addition
```bash
# Create new lambda function
mkdir lambdas/NewFunction
# Add lambda_function.py

# Deploy with smart detection
npm run deploy

# System detects new function
# Deploys only the new lambda function
```

### 4. Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production with safety checks
npm run deploy:prod

# System shows 10-second warning
# Performs comprehensive change analysis
# Deploys with production safety measures
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Reset Change Tracking
If you encounter issues with change detection:
```bash
npm run smart:reset
npm run deploy
```

### Force Full Deployment
To bypass smart detection and force full deployment:
```bash
npm run deploy:dev  # Uses traditional CDK deploy
```

### Check Deployment History
View the change tracking database:
```bash
cat .deployment-hashes.json
```

### Debug Change Detection
Run change analysis without deploying:
```bash
npm run smart:check
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Production Safety
- Production deployments include 10-second safety delay
- Always test changes in development first
- Review change summary before production deployment

### Hash Persistence
- `.deployment-hashes.json` should be committed to version control
- Resetting hashes treats all resources as new
- Hash file contains deployment metadata

### Lambda Function Detection
- System automatically detects Python vs Node.js
- Handles both `lambda_function.py` and `index.js/mjs`
- Tracks all files in lambda directories

### Infrastructure Changes
- Changes to infrastructure files trigger full stack deployment
- This ensures all dependencies are properly updated
- API Gateway, IAM, and other resources are redeployed

## 🔄 Migration from Traditional Workflow

### Before (Traditional)
```bash
# Always full deployment
npm run deploy:dev
```

### After (Smart)
```bash
# Intelligent deployment based on changes
npm run deploy
```

### Benefits
- **Faster Deployments**: Only deploy what changed
- **Reduced Risk**: Fewer resources modified per deployment
- **Better Visibility**: Clear change summary
- **Cost Optimization**: Reduced CloudFormation operations

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Deployment Time Comparison
- **Traditional**: 5-10 minutes (full stack)
- **Smart (Lambda Only)**: 1-2 minutes
- **Smart (No Changes)**: 0 minutes (skipped)

### Resource Impact
- **Traditional**: All resources processed
- **Smart**: Only changed resources processed
- **Reduced**: CloudFormation operations and API calls

## 🎉 Getting Started

1. **First Time Setup**:
   ```bash
   npm run smart:reset  # Reset change tracking
   npm run deploy       # Initial deployment
   ```

2. **Daily Development**:
   ```bash
   # Make your changes
   npm run deploy       # Smart deployment
   ```

3. **Production Release**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod  # Production deployment
   ```
